# Architecture

A MEAN stack is comprised of the 4 components that make up the architecture: MongoDB, Express js, Angular js, and Node js. MongoDB will be used as the application’s database, Express js will be used as the webserver, Angular js will be used as the customer-facing web front-end, and Node js will be used as the admin single-page application. The Angular js customer-facing website will be utilizing a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code to interact with end users, while the Node js admin single-page app will leverage JavaScript to render data to HTML.


# Functionality

Although JSON is derived from JavaScript, it's technically a different langauge altogether. With JSON, the data is stored as key/value pairs and is used as a static set of instructions for applications to use when communicating from a frontend component to a backend one.

# Testing

The testing process and methods that I took during this course and project revolved mainly around the REST api, which is comprised of five different methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. The GET method retrieves or “gets” existing records, while the POST method creates new records. The PUT method updates all the existing records however, this is only if every single record was updated successfully based on a true / false scenario. Similarly, to the PUT method, the PATCH method updates all records but only for the values specified in the URL. Lastly, the DELETE method deletes an existing record. In order to ensure that my application works correctly, I needed to test each method thoroughly and individually throughout each milestone.

# Reflection

This course has certainly helped with both my personal and professional goals as an aspiring Software Engineer. Full stack development has helped me understand what's required to build a complete application from start to finish.
